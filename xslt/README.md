**EAD_ASpace_export_post-processor.xsl** - Fixes various validation issues with Duke's ArchivesSpace EAD exports, most related to namespace conflicts carried over from Archivist Toolkit (ns2: vs. xlink:)

**aspace_dig_guide_creator.xsl** - XSLT that extracts metadata and refIDs from ASpace EAD exports and creates a digitization guide spreadsheet (TSV) suitable for use by Duke's Digital Production Center (DPC). Digital Object IDs and URIs can be added to the spreadsheet by DPC during digitization. This script should be modified based on the level of description in a given collection (file vs. item) and the metadata available for any given component in a collection (dates, subjects, etc.). The completed digitization guide can serve as the basis for batch loading digital object records in ArchivesSpace and linking those digital objects as instances to existing archival object (component) records using duke_update_archival_object.py
